# HomeStock

We built this Home stock web application to help users efficiently manage their household grocerie inventory and expenses.  
Our system allows users to track grocery stock, set budget limits, and monitor expenses.  
Users can also generate and manage shopping lists and receive alerts before items expire.  
The system includes smart pantry forecasting, developed using Python in Jupyter Notebook, which analyzes stock usage trends and predicts when items will run low.  
This forecasting feature is currently not integrated into the Spring Boot backend but can be executed separately for stock analysis.  
Secure role-based user authentication ensures personalized and protected access for each user.  
Overall, the platform supports smarter home management while reducing waste and overspending.
